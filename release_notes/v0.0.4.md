# Version 0.0.3

Added features:
* strcat function (finally) added
* made some functions more efficient
* added new command: klaud random
    * klaud random enters a random command
* added random element to klaud text-color
    * klaud text-color random will change the color to a random one
* added random element to klaud dice
    * if you put random in it will place a random bet that is in between 1 and the total amount of money you have
* made a isNum function that returns 1 if it is an integer and 0 if it isn't 
    * integrated into calc so that if the input has character values it returns 0
* made plotting less buggy. not going to lie the eval function was actual cancer so my bad
    * this fixed a weird bug where sometimes the plots would not show x > 9 (especially after klaud rizz for some reason)
